## Implementation of CNN Model for Detecting Online Gambling Ads on the Homepage via Crawling System

This project involves the integration of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model into the homepage of a website to detect spam online gambling advertisements. The system works by automatically crawling and analyzing images present on the website. The primary objective is to identify and classify whether an image contains elements related to online gambling advertisements or not.

## Key Features:

1. Automated Image Crawling: The system uses a web crawler to extract images from the homepage dynamically. This allows for continuous monitoring of the website, ensuring that all images are checked for potential spam ads in real-time.

2. CNN-based Image Classification: The CNN model, trained on a dataset of online gambling ads and non-gambling images, is applied to classify the crawled images. It effectively distinguishes between legitimate images and those containing promotional content for online gambling.

3. Real-time Detection: As the model is integrated into the homepage, it provides real-time detection of online gambling ads, enabling immediate action to block or report such content.

4. Accuracy and Scalability: The use of CNN provides a robust solution with high accuracy for image classification tasks. This ensures minimal false positives and negatives, allowing the system to scale and be used on larger platforms without compromising performance.
